100,Speaker,These speakers are incredibly amazing .
100,Speaker,"Before this I had the jbl on stage , which were also incredibly good ."
100,Speaker,But I wanted something that I can play without having to plug into a power outlet and would work on rechargable batteries .
100,Speaker,I didnt want one in which I would have to put in batteries myself -LRB- that is a pain -RRB- I did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and im glad I purchased these speakers .
100,Speaker,Most of the reviews about the sound quality is true .
100,Speaker,"The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!"
100,Speaker,Although the bass im getting out of these speakers was unexpected .
100,Speaker,"Without a doubt I would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage , and are truly portable -LRB- can be played without a power outlet , I love that feature -RRB- ."
100,Speaker,The only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight .
100,Speaker,Its not a big deal for me .
100,Speaker,The main thing I was looking for was sound quality !
100,Speaker,"I read all the reviews herein , and saw all the concerns ."
100,Speaker,"First , i was looking for an iPhone dock and FM tuner , not necessarily an alarm clock - as its for the office ."
100,Speaker,"I must say : - IT WORKS WITH IPHONE4 , EVEN WITH THIN CASE ON IT ."
100,Speaker,just push it into the slot - It charges the iPhone4 .
100,Speaker,"- It allows incoming calls to interrupt the music , and you can answer the call without having to undock it ."
100,Speaker,- It allows incoming email and TXT messages to be read and responded to w\/o undocking it - essentially you can do ALL iPhone apps while its docked .
100,Speaker,- Sound quality is good .
100,Speaker,- Tuner quality is good .
100,Speaker,"- Looks fantastic , esp w\/iPhone4 docked !!"
100,Speaker,"- Setup , from in the box to completely working , and programmed for 20 preset FM stations , was under 5 minutes ."
100,Speaker,"- I bought from an Amazon Prime Fullfiller , used like new , and it is just that - like new , not a blemish or issue , and for $ 56 ... I have no qualms about this ."
100,Speaker,"Yes , the buttons are a bit small and close , but they are functional ."
100,Speaker,My only recommendation - include a remote ... BUY THIS !
100,Speaker,"I purchased this phone set for work , thinking that inexpensive replacement phones would ease the pain of things being spilled on them or dropped ."
100,Speaker,"The sound quality has been poor since day one , the base constantly drops calls , and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base -- we can no longer use the AC adapter with the base or it turns off completely ."
100,Speaker,"When I purchased this set , I never imagined I would be running my business telephones off of 4 AA batteries ."
100,Speaker,Other complaints : you ca n't put line 1 on hold and answer line 2 with the same handset without a `` conference call '' beginning .
100,Speaker,The incoming call volume is incredibly low and it is often difficult to hear my customers -LRB- it was so bad I had my hearing tested because I thought something was wrong with me .
100,Speaker,"Yes , I 'm blonde , but this proves to me it 's the phones ! -RRB-"
100,Speaker,"I got this for use on my truck and I 'm happy with it for the most part , it is loud and super easy to install , however you are going to want an amp for i"
100,Speaker,I will never buy another GE phone again .
100,Speaker,Period .
100,Speaker,These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .
100,Speaker,These serve as my primary speakers in my living room -LRB- about 14X22 -RRB- .
100,Speaker,"They sit on stands about 8 '' high , and are pretty close to being in the corners on one of the long walls ."
100,Speaker,"I am sure that if I had spent more and gone with bigger , floor-standing units from Klipsch , I would be even more impressed , but frankly , these get the job done and do n't seem to break a sweat ."
100,Speaker,"Most of our listening is at modest volumes , but I have turned them up on some demanding tracks and they do n't flinch ."
100,Speaker,Even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers .
100,Speaker,"My only wish would be that these would 've been made in the USA rather than China , but at least the company is still mostly based here ."
100,Speaker,"I tried to use these with my laptop -LRB- Dell Inspiron 1720 -RRB- but could n't get rid of the buzzing noise others have mentioned , no matter how far I moved them from the computer or where I plugged them in ."
100,Speaker,"I took them to a different room and tested them with my mp3 player , where they worked fine and sounded pretty good ."
100,Speaker,"So -- before ordering , consider what you will use them for ."
100,Speaker,This little speaker has dynamite sound !!
100,Speaker,I should have ordered two .
100,Speaker,"My only complaint , is that the cord is not long enough ."
100,Speaker,I use it for my tablet .
100,Speaker,These stands are about 3 feet high with my Onkyo Surrounds attached .
100,Speaker,"Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture ."
100,Speaker,Wire runs through the body of the stand - giving it a very clean look .
100,Speaker,I used the double sided tape along the base for mine and it seems to be pretty secure .
100,Speaker,"I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base ."
100,Speaker,"I 'm very happy with these , I 'll probably buy 2 more for the front channels ."
100,Speaker,One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .
100,Speaker,So be mindful of your seating height before purchasing this .
100,Speaker,Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .
100,Speaker,"I got mine quick , everything works fine , botta boom botta bing ."
100,Speaker,I do wish they came with mounting screws for the speakers .
100,Speaker,The main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short .
100,Speaker,"That and for the center speaker , when I mount it on the wall its so top heavy that it falls forward , leaning out about and inch from the wall ."
100,Speaker,"I 'm trying to find some bigger screws to get it flush , but the screws attach at the bottom so there 's no support for the top of the speaker which hangs ."
100,Speaker,"Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful ."
100,Speaker,Great speakers overall .
100,Speaker,"I 'm a college kid , recreational audiophile and bass fanatic , studying engineering ."
100,Speaker,I started off building a custom sub encloser with dual Kicker CompVR 12 '' subs driven by a 1200W Sony amp .
100,Speaker,I have n't stopped searching for great sound since .
100,Speaker,"I 'm running a pair of these off an H\/K AVR240 , combined with a JBL EC35 center , a JBL S120PII 400w sub , and two sets of E30 surrounds ."
100,Speaker,I 'm big on trying anything before I buy it .
100,Speaker,I was able to listen to these and the E80s -LRB- the dual 6 '' floorstandings -RRB- at a local audio store before they were discontinued .
100,Speaker,I loved the sound of these and the Polk and Klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics .
100,Speaker,"With the JBLs at a fraction of the price here on Amazon , it was no question ."
100,Speaker,The only issue was what model to get ... I heard very little difference in qualtiy between the E60s and E80s .
100,Speaker,"The dual 6 '' put out a bit lower frequencies , but the difference was so small that I would n't be able to notice without the speakers side by side ."
100,Speaker,"Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed ."
100,Speaker,I deceided on these over the E60s with the hopes that a single 8 '' would draw less from my amp than the dual 6 '' for a bit less money .
100,Speaker,"Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass ."
100,Speaker,"They are a bit top heavy , as any tower will be ."
100,Speaker,"and I love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub ."
100,Speaker,"Movies sound great : Saving Private Ryan , Fifth Element , 40 year old virgin , Anchorman , etc. ."
100,Speaker,"Music is also fantastic -LRB- with different amp settings tuned for genre -RRB- : Ambient , electronica , hip-hop , rap , jazz , 80s , classical , rock ."
100,Speaker,"Ulrich Schnauss , Bonobo , DJ Shadow , Busta , Snoop , E40 , Louis Armstrong , Michael Jackson , Bach , Korn , Metallica , Hoobastank , 311 ."
100,Speaker,If you 're looking for a quality tower speaker ... this is it .
100,Speaker,"Bass fanatics , look at the S120PII ."
100,Speaker,you wo n't regret it .
100,Speaker,These a great speakers - full of sound .
100,Speaker,The bass is solid and can be quite impressive if turned up .
100,Speaker,The speakers look nice and are easy to use .
100,Speaker,"This is a great portable speaker system , but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iSkin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin ."
100,Speaker,I spent a lot of time looking online for this information and finally took my ipod and iskin to a store to test it out and learned this .
100,Speaker,"if you 're okay with removing the skin each time you want to use the speaker system , then by all means purchase these speakers as they are great !"
100,Speaker,Logitech have a way of seeing what is needed in any given area and bringing it to fruition .
100,Speaker,Hence the Logitech Portable Speakers are the most obvious product for personal use in this kind of area .
100,Speaker,"I have a 2 dollar radio about the same size as this unit , and whilst it is not as sturdy , it has lasted ."
100,Speaker,"Most products will last if taken care of , and Logitech 's products are no exception to this rule , however , since they are somewhat , in fact a great deal more sturdy , than my old radio ."
100,Speaker,"The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product ."
100,Speaker,"The speakers perform very well , and with the bass boost , the sound fills outs exceedingly well ."
100,Speaker,"For a small , portable , unit , this allows you to listen to , as well as share Ipod music , and podcasts , in an intimate setting ."
100,Speaker,An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .
100,Speaker,"I have owned my 5500s for a couple of years now and still love them , at least in general ."
100,Speaker,For the price there 's nothing better .
100,Speaker,I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .
100,Speaker,I 've tried to find a full-size receiver with something comparable but there 's nothing .
100,Speaker,The 5500 is effectively a ` receiver ' in that it has multiple inputs and full Dolby and DTS processing -LRB- just no radio : - -RRB- The one real problem I 've had was something that I did n't even notice until months after I 'd purchased it .
100,Speaker,When I mute the optical input the sub-woofer IS NOT muted ?!
100,Speaker,"I have my TV 's tuner connected to the optical and my HTPC connected to the coax , and I mostly use the computer to watch recordings ."
100,Speaker,"So it was only on the rare occasion that I was watching a live broadcast \* AND \* hit mute during a commercial \* AND \* that the commercial had a 5.1 soundtrack -LRB- with sub-woofer sounds , i.e. , the '' .1 '' part -RRB- that I realized there was something wrong ."
100,Speaker,I would be interested to know if any other 5500 owners have the same problem as Logitech tech support said it was an unknown problem .
100,Speaker,They offered to replace my controller but -- important to note -- they were unwilling to cross-ship it .
100,Speaker,So I would have had to go without surround sound while waiting\/trusting them to send me a replacement asap .
100,Speaker,It just was n't worth it and so I 've had to live with the problem -LRB- infrequent as it is -RRB- .
100,Speaker,This is not exactlly what I expected but I was plesentlly surprised .
100,Speaker,The sound quality is really good .
100,Speaker,The size is small .
100,Speaker,The way I have to put in my I-Pod was a little tricky but when it was done the speakers sound really good .
100,Speaker,Ive only had it a few days so I cant say anymore than that .
100,Speaker,I had the Klipsh promedia speakers before the corsair 2500 also and I can tell you the klipsh does not compare at all to the corsair .
100,Speaker,The Klipsh subwoofer is laughable .
100,Speaker,The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .
100,Speaker,The subwoofer of the corsair is miles ahead of the Klipsh .
100,Speaker,You pay for what you get .
100,Speaker,I have sb titanium fatility pro sound card .
100,Speaker,DO NOT PURCHASE ... this item will not hold a charge and spontaneously deletes the downloads ... spend the $ $ for the iPod .
100,Speaker,"Also , Amamzon will not refund me , does n't have a phone number for the manufacturer or any other contact info for Visul Land ."
100,Speaker,I was n't quite sure what to make of this speaker when it arrived .
100,Speaker,"I have no experience with ` speaker bars ' as my home theater system consists of traditional front speakers , center channel , and four rear speakers ."
100,Speaker,The speaker arived in excellent condition .
100,Speaker,The styrofoam inserts kept everything secure and undamaged .
100,Speaker,"Enclosed were the instructions , a wall mounting bracket , and a bracket for placing the speaker on a shelf ."
100,Speaker,"My inital thought was `` damn , this thing is a beast '' ."
100,Speaker,I could probably battle Orcs in the front yard with this speaker bar .
100,Speaker,The build quality is top notch .
100,Speaker,"Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups ."
100,Speaker,I chose to place the speaker on my home theater stand on the top shelf directly in front of the TV .
100,Speaker,My TV is a 46 '' Sony Bravia LCD with a Sony 7.1 home theater system .
100,Speaker,To test the speaker bar I used my new BluRay disc of Transformers 2 .
100,Speaker,Initially the sound was low and sounded `` off '' .
100,Speaker,Then I remembered to recalibrate the Sony audio since I added different speakers .
100,Speaker,After a quick calibration I fired up Transformers 2 .
100,Speaker,My initial reaction was `` WOW '' .
100,Speaker,The front sound comes directly from the front of the TV as sound should .
100,Speaker,I did n't realize that having front speakers off to the sides of the TV would make so much difference .
100,Speaker,"The sound was crisp , clear , and no distortion ."
100,Speaker,I cranked the audio up to level 40 during the best Decepticon battle .
100,Speaker,The speaker bar response was spot-on .
100,Speaker,The sounds were as the movie directors intended .
100,Speaker,I did n't get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like I did with my old front speakers .
100,Speaker,I was able to enjoy the Transformers even more than my initial viewing .
100,Speaker,For a second test I tuned into a show on ScienceHD .
100,Speaker,"Again , the sounds were spot-on and projected from where they should , the front of the TV ."
100,Speaker,Very nice since this was a normal cable HD program .
100,Speaker,I 'm quite happy with my new speaker bar .
100,Speaker,I 'm kicking myself for not embracing this technology earlier .
100,Speaker,"For those of you looking for excellent sound reproduction , expecially during a raging Decepticon battle , look no further ."
100,Speaker,This Pinnacle speaker bar is well worth the money .
100,Speaker,"It also has a 10 year warranty , which is just icing on the cake ."
100,Speaker,I recommend it to no one .
100,Speaker,Save you 're money and keep shopping .
100,Speaker,Over for the price this is a good unit .
100,Speaker,"Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good ."
100,Speaker,Build quality is great .
100,Speaker,The remote control and reciever not so good .
100,Speaker,The buttons are confusing and super small .
100,Speaker,When left on for 8 + hours you get a unusual Humm that does n't go away till cooled off .
100,Speaker,Still for the price you ca n't find better for the cost .
100,Speaker,I 'm part of the group that has had no luck with these .
100,Speaker,"They worked in the beginning ... then something fried inside the sub ... returned them , got new ones ... Same thing happened ... now they are unuseable ."
100,Speaker,They start to go when you hear the light crackling ... then it moves into the bass distortion mode ... now they just hum loudly with intermitent loud crackling .
100,Speaker,"I 'm now shopping for new speaker and when I saw that they were still available I just wanted to see what other folks were saying about them ... WOW , I 'm not alone !"
100,Speaker,"They look cool but they have a quality issue for sure ... hit or miss I guess , a gamble for sure !"
100,Speaker,"This audio bar has a great sound , even when i turn it up to the highest level on my laptop ."
100,Speaker,It only bother 's me when i want the laptop in my lap so i need the screen down a little but this device pulls it way back down .
100,Speaker,Other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and I would still purchase this all over again .
100,Speaker,"If anything sometimes I just lay it behind my laptop when it 's on the table or you could just have it laying next to you , like on the couch or something ."
100,Speaker,The sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now !
100,Speaker,I purchased 4 pairs of theese speakers and installed them in my family room -LRB- I only used 7 -RRB- for a surround sound system .
100,Speaker,they were easy to install and ended up using 300 feet of cable .
100,Speaker,For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .
100,Speaker,Billy Joel was n't kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers .
100,Speaker,The frist thing I did was put Ice Age in the Blueray Player and the THX sound check was AWESOM .
100,Speaker,My wife who really could care less about thees things was impressed I do n't think I will ever go to the movie theater again .
100,Speaker,I highly recomend theese speakers .
100,Speaker,"As always , super quick shipping by Amazon , items arrived in great shape ."
100,Speaker,"Assembly of the stands is very straightforward , and well detailed in the instructions ."
100,Speaker,"They are very sturdy , and have no trouble balance wise , or handling oddly shaped speakers ."
100,Speaker,"There are a few different mounting methods , including screws , and double back tape ."
100,Speaker,"Black ones are very unobtrusive , and kind of discrete ."
100,Speaker,I have no problem at all recommending these stands .
100,Speaker,I 'm a late user to this type of entertainment ... I still use CD 's but was recently given an Ipod and do n't know how I lived without it for so long !
100,Speaker,My wife and I travel and I thought I might be able to find a portable speaker system so that we could enjoy our music when away from home .
100,Speaker,This is my second purchase of this type of speaker and as with the first ... THIS IS N'T WHAT YOU WANT !
100,Speaker,The sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca n't hear a thing .
100,Speaker,I 'm sure it would and can be useful in a different setting ; one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper .
100,Speaker,I plan on keeping this unit for those times when using my ear buds is n't the best of ideas but this unit would n't fit my need say in a hotel room when I 'm trying to set the mood with a little music .
100,Speaker,Good quality for a small portable speaker .
100,Speaker,Convenience because it works through the USB port .
100,Speaker,I wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder .
100,Speaker,"After seeing and hearing the sound of the I-Tour Pop speaker , I was sold ."
100,Speaker,So much so that I 've already ordered 5 of the speakers for all the young adult children in our family for Christmas .
100,Speaker,"I 've been surprised at how many uses I 've found for it , I 've used it with my laptop in the kitchen , and attached to my iphone 4 , I 've used it in the car , put it on the ledge in the kitchen above the sink and watched movies while doing the dishes , and carried it from room to room while I 've listened to Pandora ."
100,Speaker,Its tiny and has really decent sound for something so small .
100,Speaker,The rechargeable battery is a great feature .
100,Speaker,Very good value for the money .
100,Speaker,I am a very pleased customer .
100,Speaker,I love this little speaker .
100,Speaker,I had purchased a black one some time ago that I was also crazy about so I bought this to have with my other devices .
100,Speaker,I was surprised how good the sound was and I especially like to use it when I am listening to audio books .
100,Speaker,Both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it .
100,Speaker,"The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- ."
100,Speaker,"However , I am still a little disappointed when you come down to the overall feeling I get from the purchase ."
100,Speaker,"To start with , I bought these for my wife to use with her iPod ."
100,Speaker,There are no incompatibility problems and they work fine .
100,Speaker,"I do find the lack of a way to turn them off , short of unplugging them a bit of a shortcoming ."
100,Speaker,"The range of response seems a little limited to me -LRB- changing the EQ setting on the iPod produces a definite change in the sound , but I would expect a little more richness in the changes -RRB- ."
100,Speaker,"The size is a bit more than I expected from Bose , a company that excels at putting good sound in small packages ."
100,Speaker,"Lastly , I feel that the speakers were over priced for what I got -LRB- unless there is some inherent benefit in the Bose label that I do n't know of -RRB- ."
100,Speaker,"Bottom line , I have a better set of speakers , in the Creative Labs I-Trigue 2200 2.0 Speakers , on my computer -LRB- at least to my ears -RRB- , for less than half the cost ."
100,Speaker,"So think hard and shop around before you jump on the Bose name , or better yet , if you can , try them out first ."
100,Speaker,"This portable speaker is easy to use , powerful enough for everyday use , and available at a pretty decent price ."
100,Speaker,It 's been working continuously as background music in my office for the past year without a hitch .
100,Speaker,The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .
100,Speaker,I recommend it over its more expensive counterparts .
100,Speaker,Awesome sound system .
100,Speaker,"Had a JVC system that was 6 years old and I thought it was good , but the Onkyo sound is amazing !"
100,Speaker,"It was easy to install all of the components and directions were easy to understand , even for an old guy like me ."
100,Speaker,The only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin .
100,Speaker,I would think that a quality system like this would have come with at least 18 or 16 guage wire .
100,Speaker,I bought this item along with a couple of other external speakers in an effort to find a good set to use in my elderly car -LRB- speaker system died -RRB- .
100,Speaker,"This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house ."
100,Speaker,"For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good ."
100,Speaker,You ca n't go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package !
100,Speaker,for what a pain in the ass setting clocks are is im walking on freaking sunshine .
100,Speaker,the soft orange glow at the base is a nice nightlight .
100,Speaker,and the sound well there is no complaints about that .
100,Speaker,It 's loud and the quality is good .
100,Speaker,A + + + + + + product and very well built for apple users in mind ... ... oh yeah theres a usb port in the back for you droid people .
100,Speaker,I was unsure myself about this system but I did enough research to take the plunge and am I glad I did .
100,Speaker,"My basement flooded recently ruining 2 sets of floor speakers leaving us listening to our Bose docking box for Iphone which we all know is great for travel , outside etc. ."
100,Speaker,"However , the Bose station did not fill the 3 room basement as we wanted so I started searching new speakers ."
100,Speaker,"The thought of buying 2 new sets of floor speakers for 300-500 $ a pair just did not make sense , plus if we flood again would I need to put them up on blocks etc. ."
100,Speaker,I have yet to here bookshelf speakers I like thus I turned to wireless options and found Sonos .
100,Speaker,"The sound is great , not as good as my $ 1000 each Klipsch R7s , but come on , for the size and price , you will not beat these units ."
100,Speaker,"I turned them up loud , ACDC Thunderstruck , wow , we rocked out , no distortion , had to back them down , lol ."
100,Speaker,"The S5 can be run solo by itself , acts as both left and right in one room , OR you can `` pair '' 2 S5 units and have one be left and one right as I did in a very large room ."
100,Speaker,"The only connection the S5 units require is an electrical outlet , rest is wireless unless you need to connect it to a router -LRB- no Bridge -RRB- or you have something to input via jack in back -LRB- ipod -RRB- ."
100,Speaker,"Remember , the music comes from any online source you can think of and your music libraries on your home network -LRB- I tunes , windows media player etc. -RRB- ."
100,Speaker,"At this point , someone Geekier than me is probably thinking of my many mistakes , omissions and lay speak but I do n't care , I do n't need your corrections , just move on ."
100,Speaker,The controller can be a Sonos one or an app for your Iphone or a controller downloaded to your PC or Mac .
100,Speaker,"I chose all 3 so I can control it anywhere , anytime , but by far the Iphone app is just stupid fun and cool ."
100,Speaker,You can control everything you need to while sitting anywhere in your home as long as you have your home wifi .
100,Speaker,"You can control each S5 player seperately , what music and what volume , tone , pause etc , all independent of other players !"
100,Speaker,You understand ?
100,Speaker,"If you have 6 of the players around your home you can play 6 different sources of music , at 6 different volumes , pause some or all , and this is all done from your Iphone !"
100,Speaker,"And you can have multiple controllers -LRB- 12 I think -RRB- , so my wife and I can fight over the volume settings while we are in different areas of the house , is hilarious ."
100,Speaker,"Well enough for this review , I just ordered the Sonos 90 unit to connect my home stereo system into the Sonos system , this unit utilizes your existing amp -LRB- receiver -RRB- and speakers and makes another zone player out of them , too cool ."
100,Speaker,"I can listen to my albums again , is crazy , good luck !"
100,Speaker,"Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system ."
100,Speaker,I did have a surround speaker buzz and crackle after 5 months .
100,Speaker,That 's the only reason I have not given this system a 5 star rating .
100,Speaker,I replaced the speaker with an ebay purchase and hope that will be the only replacement I have to worry about for a while .
100,Speaker,These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !
100,Speaker,"We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon ."
100,Speaker,"Here are my observations : Pros : + Folding ; these have a very clever design that allows them to fold in to a small cube for easy transporting + Good Sound ; produces fairly good sound at all but the highest volume levels -LRB- see `` Cons '' , below -RRB- , at least to my untrained ear + Universal Connector ; the unit uses a standard mini connector , so this can be used with all of MP3 players + Power Options ; comes with a USB power cable or it can use 4 x AAA batteries ."
100,Speaker,"You can also use a 6v DC power supply -LRB- not included -RRB- Cons : - Bad Instructions ; like many products of this type the instructions manual is lacking and , in this case , erroneously lists the power requirements as AC when it should be DC ."
100,Speaker,Very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality .
100,Speaker,Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .
100,Speaker,This product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx501 to my Toyota camry 2001 mode .
100,Speaker,It works flawlessly during installation of cx501 .
100,Speaker,I had heard one of these in a colleague 's office and was amazed ... I like mine too !
100,Speaker,"I was looking for an inexpensive , room-suited ipod speaker and this is what I got ."
100,Speaker,"The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion ."
100,Speaker,My biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my 2nd generation iPod Nano .
100,Speaker,"A new dock was added I see , but the iPod can not be played with the dock unless I hold down the top ."
100,Speaker,"It works fine without the dock , but it 's shaky and unstable ."
100,Speaker,"So besides the annoyances , this is a fine speaker for the amount I paid ."
100,Speaker,For the cost of this product i could not ask for more .
100,Speaker,The sound quality is very exceptable .
100,Speaker,"The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it ."
100,Speaker,"All in all , could n't be more happy with the purchase ."
100,Speaker,Easy set up and the picture was crystal clear .
100,Speaker,I use it for the xbox as well as my computer and I cried with joy .
100,Speaker,OK enough said just buy it .
100,Speaker,Love this speaker .
100,Speaker,Sounds awesome .
100,Speaker,Works super easy .
100,Speaker,Looks great .
100,Speaker,Seems to be durable enough but I 've only had it a few weeks so we 'll see .
100,Speaker,My only complaint is like others here ... it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it 's really annoying when it does because it does it so often .
100,Speaker,"If it did n't do that , it would be perfect ."
100,Speaker,"Because of that though , I am tempted to send it back ."
100,Speaker,This little item blew my sock off when I heard the sound of it .
100,Speaker,full spectrum sound from full base to great highs .
100,Speaker,it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand .
100,Speaker,I would recomend this unit to anyone .
100,Speaker,I have found this little device to be quite fun to use .
100,Speaker,The range seems quite good even through walls .
100,Speaker,I mainly use it with my Apple IPad and it really sounds quite good for it diminutive size .
100,Speaker,"I find the issue with it connecting to be a little problematic , but it connects eventually ."
100,Speaker,Not bad overall .
100,Speaker,"These are great if you want radio , but your radio is too far away to hear and you do n't want to blast it ."
100,Speaker,"The range is great , I can list to my radio anywhere in the house ."
100,Speaker,I just move my speaker to whatever room I 'm cleaning or whatever room I want to listen to the music at .
100,Speaker,"If you are hosting a party and want music to play throughout your house , this would be a great option as well ."
100,Speaker,All you need is an outlet and you are good to go !
100,Speaker,I 'm a big fan of lapdesks for my netbook and notebook PCs .
100,Speaker,I use them to protect my legs from the heat output as well as for comfort .
100,Speaker,"When Logitech introduced their new line of lapdesks with built-in external speakers for portable computers , I was so excited !"
100,Speaker,"While my laptop and netbook have decent speakers , the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers , making it harder to hear some audio ."
100,Speaker,Logitech 's N550 Speaker Lapdesk wins in the area of comfort .
100,Speaker,The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .
100,Speaker,The speakers themselves sound really good .
100,Speaker,Powering it from the laptop or netbook 's USB port keeps your computing experience truly portable as you do n't need to plug in to an external power source .
100,Speaker,"Even better , you do n't have to worry about constantly replacing batteries ."
100,Speaker,"The right side of the lapdesk has three convenienctly placed volume control buttons : Mute , Volume Up , and Volume Down ."
100,Speaker,Installing the lapdesk on both Windows XP and Windows Vista computers was a snap - the drivers installed automatically as soon as the device was plugged in with no need for a software install or a reboot .
100,Speaker,One thing I missed was an area for an external mouse .
100,Speaker,I almost always use one with both my netbook and my laptop .
100,Speaker,"While the netbook is small enough to leave room for an external mouse , there really is n't enough room for it with my laptop , which is 14 '' ."
100,Speaker,"Which brings me to the next point : this is advertised as being for small laptops and netbooks that are 14 '' and under in size , and that is certainly true ."
100,Speaker,"All in all , this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers ."
100,Speaker,This is one of the nicest electronic devices that I 've ever owned .
100,Speaker,This is nice enough that it will go with any deluxe home configuration .
100,Speaker,"The speakers are pretty small , so they wo n't take up a lot of space , but they play as loud as you want them to , and they have great quality ."
100,Speaker,I paired this very easily to two different Android phones .
100,Speaker,"For inputs , you can either use Bluetooth or a standard audio jack ."
100,Speaker,It also has a headphone out .
100,Speaker,This means that the device is discoverable .
100,Speaker,"\* If the light blinks blue slowly , then you did n't press the Bluetooth button long enough \* Turn on Bluetooth on your Android \* Scan for devices on your Android \* On your Android , the device name will be , `` Creative T12 Wireless '' \* Choose `` Pair with this device '' on your Android ."
100,Speaker,I never needed a password .
100,Speaker,"\* It will automatically pair , and now you can play music ."
100,Speaker,This product is amazing !!!
100,Speaker,The sound this slim design puts out !!
100,Speaker,I could n't beleive what I purchased after I received the item .
100,Speaker,Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .
100,Speaker,Do n't purchase it .
100,Speaker,THIS PRODUCT WAS AS ADVERTISED AND FULFILLED MY EXPECTATIONS .
100,Speaker,I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND WOULD BUY IT AGAIN IF NEEDED .
100,Speaker,AGAIN THIS PRODUCT IS RECOMMENDED BY THIS REVIEWER .
100,Speaker,"It 's a fun little gadget , do n't expect high definition sound ."
100,Speaker,I had read about the soundbugs on various websites in the past ; I eventually bought it out of curiosity .
100,Speaker,"The best use that I found so far for the soundbug , is putting it on the glass of the sliding balcony door to listen to the music outside , while keeping the door shut -LRB- because of the A\/C , for example -RRB- ."
100,Speaker,Another use is to connect it to a portable mp3 player ...
100,Speaker,I purchased these for my desk at work .
100,Speaker,They sound really good just as the reviews say .
100,Speaker,A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .
100,Speaker,They are n't quite as loud as some of the reviews seem to imply but that could be because of the acoutics of the area they are in .
100,Speaker,The switch being in the back is a little awkward as the other reviews also mention and the `` pulse '' is n't really all that but that is irrelevant to me .
100,Speaker,They do look cool in the dark though .
100,Speaker,Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .
100,Speaker,I tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price .
100,Speaker,Bought the Klipsch 2.1 and found them clearly superior to these .
100,Speaker,"If you are concerned about looks , get these ."
100,Speaker,"If you want good sound , STAY AWAY !!!"
100,Speaker,Best HT upgrade I 've made in over 2 years .
100,Speaker,I am a cheapskate when it comes to spending .
100,Speaker,"I always obsess about researching others reviews before I pull the trigger , especially when it comes to electronics or books ."
100,Speaker,I will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker .
100,Speaker,"Now , I am not all that technical when it comes to anything , I have just learned from the experience -LRB- and skills , technical know-how , etc. -RRB- of others , but my ears do not lie ."
100,Speaker,"I recently purchased some Sennheiser headphones , which have done wonders for audio when on the bus to and from work ."
100,Speaker,"Well , this speaker does the same wonders for my low-end HT setup ."
100,Speaker,Dialogue is very noticeably clearer .
100,Speaker,Sound effects really sound more authentic .
100,Speaker,"While watching Good Will Hunting yesterday , there was a scene where whathisface starts up his birthday gift car , and I thought , yes , that does sound like a car just started in my family room !"
100,Speaker,"I also noticed that in general volume levels can be much lower and the dialogue will still be understandable , even when I had a room air conditioner AND another fan blowing at max in the same room ."
100,Speaker,"Well , stop reading my review and pull the trigger , you will have no regrets like me and others !"
100,Speaker,"Well , except for the fact that I bus to work\/home , so when it arrived at my work , I was carrying a 25 lb ."
100,Speaker,"The box was the size of a large boombox , and I would occasionally peer about me on the way home , partially wondering when I was going to get jacked for the speaker !"
100,Speaker,": -RRB- P.S. BTW , the robbery never occurred , I got home safe and sound ..."
100,Speaker,The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .
100,Speaker,The second set is working just fine .
100,Speaker,"You can fill a small room with sound pretty good , but do n't think it rivals a home theater system ."
100,Speaker,Music sounds great but having surround sound in game is nice and a big difference from headphones .
100,Speaker,"They are currently marked down to $ 70 , that is the lowest I have seen them and definitely worth it ."
100,Speaker,These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .
100,Speaker,They are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub .
100,Speaker,You will not be dissapointed .
100,Speaker,In addition the price point is spectacular .
100,Speaker,"I read an earlier review that these speakers have to be protected from weather somewhat when used outdoors , so I thought they 'd make fine speakers for the bathroom , and I was right ."
100,Speaker,I 'm to lazy to register so I used the kid 's review form .
100,Speaker,So let 's get started .
100,Speaker,These are the only computer speakers I 've ever bought so I have no comparison to anything else .
100,Speaker,"The speakers actually sound like speakers , average speakers though ."
100,Speaker,"The subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned ALL THE WAY DOWN , but it 's all right because these are computer speakers ."
100,Speaker,"These are more suitable for hip hop or rock , the dialogue sounds unnatural and piano music sounds like MIDI -LRB- lol -RRB- ."
100,Speaker,"Some may not like the horn tweeters , as they tend to sound too hot ."
100,Speaker,I usually avoid horns but I do n't hear anything overly extreme .
100,Speaker,This system is very powerful .
100,Speaker,It played clean up to the highest levels -LRB- except for the subwoofer which had port noise -RRB- .
100,Speaker,It effortlessly filled by medium-sized room with sound .
100,Speaker,"Do n't be mislead by the THX logo on it , though ."
100,Speaker,The requirements for computer speakers are n't as strict as the ones for theater equipment .
100,Speaker,"In other words , you 're not going to watch Star Wars on this thing ."
100,Speaker,So it all comes together .
100,Speaker,"This is a great 3-piece speaker system for a computer , and it 's worth every penny ."
100,Speaker,Audiophiles though would n't bother with such mediocre equipment -LRB- so bug off -RRB- and GO LISTEN TO THEIR MUSIC SOMEWHERE ELSE .
100,Speaker,"I broke this in for more than 400 hours , not continuously or course ."
100,Speaker,This is the best sound system I have ever heard .
100,Speaker,It beats my Z 680 which I accidently destroyed by a water spill .
100,Speaker,The woofer is much larger .
100,Speaker,When I saw a lot of plastic where there was metal I was concerned that the sound would not be as good .
100,Speaker,But it is better .
100,Speaker,I would recommend this to anyone looking for the type of surround sound found in the theaters .
100,Speaker,During games it will shake your seat bottom and the floor and maybe even the neighbors floor if they live too close .
100,Speaker,"If I were to rate these speakers on my listening needs , I would give a 2.5 stars , but I 'm giving 4 because I think they do the job that most people want them for ."
100,Speaker,"What I do n't like is that at lower volume music listening , tonal qualities are very poor ."
100,Speaker,I have to make equalizer adjustments for every different song to make it sound right .
100,Speaker,There are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built-in speaker crossovers .
100,Speaker,You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .
100,Speaker,"However , once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work I like to get done with some background music , viola , the audio is great -LRB- well , this is relative - great for a computer speaker -RRB- ."
100,Speaker,Pros : - Great sound for a $ 100 speaker at mid to higher levels .
100,Speaker,Definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers I 've owned .
100,Speaker,- Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .
100,Speaker,- Construction : all components are pretty rugged and seem built to last .
100,Speaker,"- Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy ."
100,Speaker,"- If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- ."
100,Speaker,Cons : - I think the satellites look ugly .
100,Speaker,The metal grills remind me of '80s boom boxes .
100,Speaker,"Also , certifications do n't impress me , so I 'd really rather not be reminded every time that I look at the speaker that I probably paid an extra % 15 just for Logitech to have these THX certified ."
100,Speaker,- Ported sub woofer not appropriate for this set up .
100,Speaker,"This is a preference , but since these speakers are more than capable of loud levels , I 'd be willing to sacrifice some efficiency to have an enclosed woofer that is much more accurate and less ... redolent of a teenager 's car system ."
100,Speaker,- Games and video can sound very tinny if you do n't do some adjustments on the software end when you switch from music .
100,Speaker,"While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad ."
100,Speaker,- Fixed speaker cable -- why do this ?
100,Speaker,To increase the likelihood that we have to buy new speakers in a few years ?
100,Speaker,- Sub woofer is large .
100,Speaker,"For those who want the thump that this is capable of producing -LRB- very good for a computer speaker -RRB- , this is probably necessary ."
100,Speaker,I just do n't want this .
100,Speaker,Conclusion : I was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day I got them .
100,Speaker,I decided to give them a chance and I 've gotten a little more used to them .
100,Speaker,"I 'm still very frustrated with some of the properties , but now that I have saved equalizer settings and know I have to open up my sound card 's control panel every time I switch between music and videos or games , the sound is much more acceptable ."
100,Speaker,I really just want quality sound for listening to my music at moderate levels while I 'm doing work on my computer and these speakers really do n't shine until you start to crank them .
100,Speaker,I tried to adjust my rating a bit higher assuming that many people probably want exactly what these do -LRB- and I 'm happy I do n't live in an apartment next to you -RRB- .
100,Speaker,I love this speakers .
100,Speaker,Sound quality and base is amazing .
100,Speaker,This tiny speakers produce really big sound .
100,Speaker,I would strongly recommend this product !
100,Speaker,"The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio ."
100,Speaker,This is proof that good things come in small packages .
100,Speaker,"This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods ."
100,Speaker,I set it up in my living room and the sound was superb .
100,Speaker,"It played my Sandisk e260 beautifully , and then we jacked in my son 's IPOD 30 Gig and it played it perfectly as well ."
100,Speaker,This is a superb system and highly recommended .
100,Speaker,"It is smaller than I expected when I ordered it , but as it turns out , so much the better ."
100,Speaker,A great system at an incredible price .
100,Speaker,"I 'm not easily impressed by electronics , tending to be a little conservative , but this product really deserves five stars ."
100,Speaker,Operates off household current as well as batteries .
100,Speaker,"If you do n't have the smaller size Sandisk MP3 -LRB- mine is bigger than the series the dock is designed for -RRB- , the player does not fit in the dock , but it jacked into the audio input with a cord that is included ."
100,Speaker,"A small cosmetic issue , but good to know ."
100,Speaker,"However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well ."
100,Speaker,"These are good looking , durable speaker stands ."
100,Speaker,I have n't even used the carpet tacks that came with the stands and they are hard to knock over .
100,Speaker,I bought them along with one of the specified speakers suggested by Harmon .
100,Speaker,"They are seamless when looking at them straight on , but at side and 3\/4 views -LRB- pictures that were not available on line -RRB- the rear of the speaker is visible ."
100,Speaker,Overall they are great stands and look good .
100,Speaker,Assembly is a little awkward because the drawings are n't that great .
100,Speaker,Go to Harmon on line to see better instructions if needed .
100,Speaker,"I have two , the XtremeMac Luna Voyager and this iHome iP16GXC ."
100,Speaker,Both provide a docking port for the iPod\/iPhone on the top panel .
100,Speaker,Both then sync with the device so as to display the time .
100,Speaker,"The XtremeMac , which is just a few dollars less expensive than the iHome model , has a blue florescent digit display for the clock while the iHome has a backlit LCD display ."
100,Speaker,"While the XtremeMac looks cooler , the iHome is actually more legible from a distance and easier to read at a glance ."
100,Speaker,"Both , at the touch of a button , start playing music from the content of the iDevice ."
100,Speaker,The iDevice is then accessed to change songs .
100,Speaker,Volume is adjusted from the iHome .
100,Speaker,"Both units have an alarm clock capability , with the iPod\/iPhone utilized for the musical accompaniment ."
100,Speaker,"The big difference in the two units , beyond their appearance , is in sound quality ."
100,Speaker,"Both units are small , with similarly small speakers ."
100,Speaker,"The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level ."
100,Speaker,"When I first listened to the XtremeMac , I thought there was only a single speaker ."
100,Speaker,The iHome 's stereo reproduction is clearly superior .
100,Speaker,Vocals have greater clarity with the iHome as well .
100,Speaker,"The speakers of the XtremeMac are built into the unit , out of harm 's way , and this is advantageous in a dusty environment or one in which small children might poke and prod at the unit ."
100,Speaker,"On the iHome , the speaker domes are out in the open at the end of the unit ."
100,Speaker,They can be easily damaged if poked .
100,Speaker,"Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage ."
100,Speaker,The iHome has a watch-type battery to hold time if the power goes out .
100,Speaker,It takes four AA batteries if portability is desired away from an AC line while still using the built in speakers and amplifier .
100,Speaker,"I tested it with the original iPhone , the iPhone3GS , and the iPhone4 -LRB- ATT -RRB- and had no problems with any of these sources ."
100,Speaker,"Well , a friend of mine 's got the tower without the bluetooth feature , and it was really awesome so for a long time i was willing to buy a tower from this particular brand , 30 extra dolars for the bluetooth feature isnt bad at all ."
100,Speaker,"I got it today , it works great , great sound for its size and price , I understand that the volume for iPhone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so I do n't complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iPhone , I highly recommend this tower ."
100,Speaker,"First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way ."
100,Speaker,I also disagree that this system sounds like a boombox .
100,Speaker,It sounds great !
100,Speaker,"I chose this system in particular because it 's THX Certified , so I knew it was unlikely that they 'd sound disappointingly bad ."
100,Speaker,"They sound wonderful , in my opinion , and I have n't even touched any equalizers ."
100,Speaker,I got them for my girlfriend so she would n't be stuck with 2W laptop speakers anymore .
100,Speaker,I 'm breaking them in with some trance at a moderate volume right now .
100,Speaker,"Mid-range is n't the best , but it 's certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend $ 300 + on computer speakers ."
100,Speaker,"The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy ."
100,Speaker,"In fact , it beats my -LRB- albeit 11 year old -RRB- Altec Lansing ADA885 system 's subwoofer -LRB- system originally $ 300 -RRB- ."
100,Speaker,"Bottom line is for the price , these things sound GREAT and have tons of good bass ."
100,Speaker,Highly recommend .
100,Speaker,"Definitely worth spending the extra money over a cheaper $ 60 system ... grab these instead , you 'll be glad you did ."
100,Speaker,These are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park .
100,Speaker,"What it really is , is a pouch with speaker - the zippers open up a little bucket for your sunglasses and your cell phone inside ."
100,Speaker,The waterproof feature is also true because it is still working after 2 hours in drizzle .
100,Speaker,The mount is easy to use ... it 's just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars .
100,Speaker,I have a bike light so I had to remove it to cater enough space to put this speaker on .
100,Speaker,It is also a bit bigger than expected but that 's OK because all I need is something to work with my iphone .
100,Speaker,"I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users ."
100,Speaker,I was super excited to receive this little speaker .
100,Speaker,"I got this item for the sole reason to use on my iPad since the built-in speaker on that device is horribly low , even in quiet rooms !"
100,Speaker,I plugged this baby in my iPod and had 5 people in the living room speak at the same time to see if this thing can overpower that noise .
100,Speaker,Man was I surprised !
100,Speaker,This thing drowned all five people out !
100,Speaker,My brother and I were equally shocked at how loud this thing really is .
100,Speaker,"After my first test run with it , my brother took my smartphone , logged into my Amazon account , and bought one for himself ."
100,Speaker,Yes he asked first lol .
100,Speaker,I am planning on posting a video to show how loud this thing is .
100,Speaker,"I deducted a star because , when I put my iPod and iPad on full volume , the speaker 's bass began to completely ruin the sound ."
100,Speaker,It sounded like an busted up speaker and the lyrics were muffled .
100,Speaker,That kind of annoyed me ... a lot .
100,Speaker,"But to remedy this , all I did was set my iPod and iPad to either Treble reducer or Bass Reducer ."
100,Speaker,The sound became instantly clear again .
100,Speaker,"I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !"
100,Speaker,Upon opening these I found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them .
100,Speaker,They use a design that has a passive radiator that takes up most of the back of each speaker .
100,Speaker,"You get a power\/volume knob , headphone jack , and Bluetooth button on the front and power , speaker to speaker , and line-in on the back ."
100,Speaker,There are a few things that I do n't like about the design .
100,Speaker,There is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver .
100,Speaker,They used a glossy finish on the front .
100,Speaker,I have found that around the knob is all smudged up and scratched now from normal use .
100,Speaker,"If would have been much nicer if they had put nubs\/tread around the volume knob , it would have provided a more positive grip and given more feedback ."
100,Speaker,With the smooth knob I find it hard to judge if I am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone .
100,Speaker,Pairing to a Bluetooth device is the usual no problem activity that I have come to expect from creative speakers .
100,Speaker,No complaints there .
100,Speaker,I also did n't run into any problems using the speakers with any of my Bluetooth devices .
100,Speaker,When I first setup the speakers I saw a note in the manual to not place the speakers backs against a wall or solid surface .
100,Speaker,I sat the speakers on my computer desk at home -LRB- not up against a wall -RRB- and was really meh about how these sounded .
100,Speaker,I had decided that I did n't want to keep these at home and decided to take them to work because I did n't need really good sounding speakers at work .
100,Speaker,Well when I hooked these up in my cubicle at work they sounded like totally different speakers .
100,Speaker,I could n't believe how much better they sounded .
100,Speaker,So the conclusion I have reached is that placement for these speakers is very important .
100,Speaker,They might sound good in your situation they might not .
100,Speaker,It is hard to tell .
100,Speaker,This is the best speaker mount I had so far .
100,Speaker,"Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works ."
100,Speaker,This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .
100,Speaker,It is what you would expect for a ~ $ 30 dock .
100,Speaker,The sound is far from good and there 's a lot of interference mainly when doing any Wifi activity .
100,Speaker,Volume level is OK .
100,Speaker,material is on the cheap side .
100,Speaker,I was expecting more based on the rest of the comments but I guess for ~ $ 30 is `` OK ''
100,Speaker,JBL S310 II is truly amazing .
100,Speaker,Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .
100,Speaker,I own two of these and I have configured these as my front left & right speakers .
100,Speaker,"I am using JBL N38 II as surround left & right , which is again a very nice excellent speaker set ."
100,Speaker,The Rear Left & Right speakers are JBL N-Center II speakers .
100,Speaker,"The Center channel is JBL - S - Center II , this unit is very powerful and produces crystal clear dialogues , and it 's a 3-way speaker system ."
100,Speaker,JBL 150W PB10 Sub woofer provides the low frequency effects .
100,Speaker,All of the above mentioned items are powered and driven by Harmon Kardon AVR 525 7.1 Receiver .
100,Speaker,"Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment, the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity ."
100,Speaker,"Even though this unit produces 70W per channel , it powerful enough to make an earthquake at -10 db ."
100,Speaker,I am very happy about my investment and the quality service of Amazon and J & R store .
100,Speaker,"Great product , works perfectly for my office !!!"
100,Speaker,I even take it home so I can use it when I am working out !!
100,Speaker,"This product is a must have , believe I did my research ."
100,Speaker,"I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!"
100,Speaker,"I very rarely review any type of electronic devise , so I 'm sort of in uncharted territory here ."
100,Speaker,All I can say is that this is an excellent devise .
100,Speaker,The word `` amazing '' even comes to mind .
100,Speaker,I have a very small laptop computer .
100,Speaker,"I was doubtful that this device would be able to do anything helpful for my laptop , but it virtually turned my laptop into a stereo system !"
100,Speaker,I highly recommend this device !
100,Speaker,Who ever does n't buy these speakers is CRAZY not to ... .
100,Speaker,Enjoy enjoy enjoy the best !
100,Speaker,OMG >> >> >> -RRB- Please buy these you will be in heaven .
100,Speaker,Just for around the computer you will enjoy music like you never did before .
100,Speaker,Buy Them ...
100,Speaker,THE BEST BUY IN TOWN .
100,Speaker,FAR SURPASSES ANYTHING I 'VE HEARD TO DATE FOR THEIR SUPERIOR SOUND .
100,Speaker,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED .
100,Speaker,"Apart from being very easy to install , and the excellent music quality , what I really find fascinating is discovering new artists with Internet radio stations or music providers ."
100,Speaker,"Before Sonos I was n't very convinced about internet music , but Sonos experience is so rich -LRB- numerous sources -RRB- and easy -LRB- there is almost no setup -RRB- making listening to internet radio a pleasure ."
100,Speaker,Got these for my laptop which has terrible sound volume .
100,Speaker,They sound wonderful the only issue is where to put them when I move around .
100,Speaker,These speakers are great .
100,Speaker,They deliver great 5.1 sound when hooked up and ACTUALLY RECEIVING A 5.1 SIGNAL .
100,Speaker,"All of my music outputs in 2\/2 .1 at best except for some FLAC files , but it puts out the sound for Skyrim , movies with the proper audio data , and other similar media with a lot of quality ."
100,Speaker,"The sub is downfiring and much more compact than my last batch of Logitech speakers -LRB- Which died after over 7 years of use , a very satisfying ROI -RRB- ."
100,Speaker,"My last set of speakers were Logitech and they lasted well past their expected life span with a variety of use and abuse , if these hold up like every other logitech product I 've owned I 'll be very happy ."
100,Speaker,This review is just a warning to anyone with an 8 ohm amplifier : I originally purchased these because they reviewed well .
100,Speaker,"However , they are 4 ohm speakers , and the amp I ordered is 8 ohms ."
100,Speaker,"The manufacturer 's website says that they are 8 ohms , but when you download the manual , it says the impedance is 4-6 ohms ."
100,Speaker,I was able to cancel the order before shipping .
100,Speaker,-LRB- THANKS AMAZON ! -RRB-
100,Speaker,What I found as a replacement for about the same money were the Bic America RTRV44-2 .
100,Speaker,"They rate better as well , 4.5 stars compared to 4 stars , with NO 1 star reviews ."
100,Speaker,"So I have ordered these , and they are on their way ."
100,Speaker,PROTECT YOUR UNIT AND TURN ON & OFF SPEAKERS WHERE EVER YOU ARE OUT SIDE OR IN ... GREG ROCK ON CROYDON ROCKS
100,Speaker,I had bought a logitech X240 and I knew that I was not going to keep it the very first day as it was merely a big piece of junk .
100,Speaker,Well it had good power but no precision at all .
100,Speaker,"After reading many reviews about X230 , I ordered it -LRB- through office depot for 34 bucks and free shipping which only took 2 days with UPS -RRB- ."
100,Speaker,"Wow , this speaker really rocks ."
100,Speaker,"Even with its sub volume all the way down , you will hear the complete spectrum of instruments at different pitches and can recognize them one by one ."
100,Speaker,The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .
100,Speaker,Really happy with the purchase .
100,Speaker,"After arriving earlier than anticipated , I made a test of two three foot sections ."
100,Speaker,Perfect !
100,Speaker,"When I put it to use for my daughter 's graduation party in longer lengths , the speaker wire worked as expected , even out of doors ."
100,Speaker,"If you want a quality product , delivered on time , buy this one ."
100,Speaker,Tiny .
100,Speaker,Powerful .
100,Speaker,Portable .
100,Speaker,Great Sound .
100,Speaker,"Seriously , I had to turn it down !"
100,Speaker,"It will `` dance '' a little on the table if it 's turned up really high , which is kinda cute , but you do n't want the little guy to hurt himself , so I put a small piece of that slip guard meant for under rugs and kitchen shelves and it worked wonderfully !"
100,Speaker,I 'm buying a second one !
100,Speaker,Just the fact that you can carry all your music and different genres on cards that take up no room at all makes this a huge PRO factor for me .
100,Speaker,Fabulous BUY !!!
100,Speaker,I 've never owned a surround sound system before this .
100,Speaker,And now I do n't think I can go back to the old school stereo again .
100,Speaker,The subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high !
100,Speaker,I can shake my whole house !
100,Speaker,Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .
100,Speaker,I disagree .
100,Speaker,They are at least 12 feet long and if you need something longer than that you should move up to a home theater system rather than a PC kit .
100,Speaker,"Note : To experience these speakers to the full , you will need to have a good sound card -LRB- 5 or more ports -RRB- otherwise the rear and center speakers may not work ."
100,Speaker,You will probally also need to setup the sound card to use 5.1 sound .
100,Speaker,This can be done through the control panel - -RRB- sounds and devices - -RRB- advanced and if this does n't work you 'll need to use the software that comes with your sound card and adjust speaker setting to 5.1 .
100,Speaker,I have a realtek soundcard and found it in the control panel under the name `` sound effects manager . ''
100,Speaker,"Overall , this is the BEST 5.1 set for under $ 100 ."
100,Speaker,I 'd venture to say that because of it 's low cost it 's the best PC stereo set out there costwise .
100,Speaker,If you buy a 6.1 or 7.1 system you wo n't get that much of a sound improvement other than volume .
100,Speaker,"And for a small room , this thing can crank it out enough to hurt your ears !"
100,Speaker,The Audio Cube is great .
100,Speaker,"The sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit ."
100,Speaker,I bought this unit to use a speaker in the bedroom as well as a nightly dock to charge my iPad and provide additional sound for an alarm app .
100,Speaker,It works great for this purpose .
100,Speaker,There is also an additional input to charge\/play music from another non iOS device .
100,Speaker,I like it because it is soft and flexible that I can run it along the edges of the door .
100,Speaker,Does what it should and the sound seems fine to me .
100,Speaker,I guess you may want to get some of those tips for the ends to make it easier to connect to the speakers .
100,Speaker,This setup worked perfectly the first shot at it .
100,Speaker,"I did not even have to hit the `` auto tune '' button , it just worked instantly ."
100,Speaker,"Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring ."
100,Speaker,"If you want background music , better than your TV sound for movies , speakers around the house for parties , outside get togethers , this is about as good as you can expect , for the price ."
100,Speaker,"I have not had any of the bad issues that I saw in other reviews , and we are very pleased with the purchase ."
100,Speaker,Works great !
100,Speaker,Easy to pair !
100,Speaker,Great sound !
100,Speaker,Good battery life !
100,Speaker,Life is good .
100,Speaker,Great gift for any one !
100,Speaker,Good price !
100,Speaker,The controls are hard to see and not intuitive .
100,Speaker,"But , adjusting the picture settings is a one time thing for most people ."
100,Speaker,"When I saw these cables , I could n't have been more excited ."
100,Speaker,These were the cables from my youth .
100,Speaker,I am sure that my appreciation of fine music would never have developed were it not for the audiophile quality sound that these cables were able to extract from my little Fischer-Price phonograph .
100,Speaker,The sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like Carnegie Hall .
100,Speaker,-LRB- If Carnegie hall had been built on a cloud in heaven . -RRB-
100,Speaker,"So , I traded my Prius in for a 1975 Dodge Dart -LRB- with a built in 8-track - I knew these cables would make that ROCK -RRB- and chose expedited shipping ."
100,Speaker,Within seconds the confirmation email arrived .
100,Speaker,I plugged in the tracking number and was surprised to learn that the item had already been delivered .
100,Speaker,BACK IN 1963 !!!!!
100,Speaker,So that 's where I got those from .
100,Speaker,I thought Aunt Loretta had sent them .
100,Speaker,I mean I guess I got my money 's worth .
100,Speaker,I just wish I had n't ruined them by hooking them onto my bicycle spokes with a clothespin .
100,Speaker,"Oh , well ."
100,Speaker,"If this kidney sells , I 'll be able to afford another pair ."
100,Speaker,I 'm A + if anyone is interested .
100,Speaker,I have loved my rock speaker for about 3 years .
100,Speaker,I have it in my garden .
100,Speaker,Last summer I thought I 'd like to have 2 more placed around my garden .
100,Speaker,Since spring is right around the corner I thought now was the time .
100,Speaker,I use them with music coming from my computer .
100,Speaker,I absolutely LOVE these speakers .
100,Speaker,"This phone was advertised as a 3 line phone -- I checked and re-checked tht listing on the description when purchasing -- and now that I want to return it , I get NO RESPONSE from Eek Technology whom it was purchased from ."
100,Speaker,\* POORLY LISTED \* NO CUSTOMER SERVICE ON A RETURN \* WO N'T DO THIS AGAIN !!!
100,Speaker,I ordered Harmon Kardon Soundstick II and I returned them .
100,Speaker,I own Harmon Kardon Soundstick I and I must say that these speakers do n't compare with the Harmon Kardon Soundstick II .
100,Speaker,The sound quality is very poor .
100,Speaker,On a scale of 1-10 I would say it is a 2 at best .
100,Speaker,Do n't buy these .
100,Speaker,Harmon Kardon should go back to the old style of speakers with the USB instead of the new plugs .
100,Speaker,"Warning : These speakers are marketed as speakers for your TV , PlayStation , or DVD player -- not your computer ."
100,Speaker,They have RCA inputs ; they want you to use the enclosed RCA cable to connect the audio outputs from your TV\/PlayStation\/DVD directly to the speakers .
100,Speaker,This would be great in a dorm room or bedroom setting where you may not already have a stereo receiver and want better sound than what your TV is giving you .
100,Speaker,"If your computer is anything like mine , you will need to get a different cord , in a `` Y '' shape , where the `` top '' of the `` Y '' are 2 RCA male connectors -LRB- these plug into the speakers -RRB- , and the `` bottom '' of the `` Y '' is a single male headphone jack connector -LRB- this plugs into your computer -RRB- ."
100,Speaker,"You can get one of these cable at just about any electronics store for a few bucks , but it would have been nice to have had it included out-of-the-box ."
100,Speaker,I was bummed to open the box and realize that I could n't enjoy the speakers right away .
100,Speaker,": - -LRB- All that being said , the speakers have good sound quality ."
100,Speaker,"I am using them in my office , and they generally sound good ."
100,Speaker,"However , since I am in an office , I normally keep them at a pretty low volume , and at low volumes , they sound a little weak ."
100,Speaker,"Once I turn up the volume a touch , they sound really good ."
100,Speaker,"I 'm not sure that any speakers could offer me high fidelity at very low volumes , though ."
