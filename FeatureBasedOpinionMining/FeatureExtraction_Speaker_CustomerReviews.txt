product/title:Speaker
review/text: Most of our listening is at modest volumes , but I have turned them up on some demanding tracks and they do not flinch .

product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I am very happy with these , I all probably buy more for the front channels .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .

product/title:Speaker
review/text: So be mindful of your seating height before purchasing this .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker

product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I do wish they came with mounting screws for the speakers .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The main problems for me is that the sub cord from the sub to the control station is too short .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: That and for the center speaker , when I mount it on the wall its so top heavy that it falls forward , leaning out about and inch from the wall .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I am trying to find some bigger screws to get it flush , but the screws attach at the bottom so there is no support for the top of the speaker which hangs .

product/title:Speaker
review/text: With the Jbs at a fraction of the price here on Amazon , it was no question .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The only issue was what model to get I heard very little difference in quality between the Es and Es .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The dual '' put out a bit lower frequencies , but the difference was so small that I would not be able to notice without the speakers side by side .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Living in a small college apartment the Es and Es were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .

product/title:Speaker
review/text: In addition the price point is spectacular .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I read an earlier review that these speakers have to be protected from weather somewhat when used outdoors , so I thought they d make fine speakers for the bathroom , and I was right .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I am to lazy to register so I used the kid is review form .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: So let is get started .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: These are the only computer speakers I Ve ever bought so I have no comparison to anything else .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The speakers actually sound like speakers , average speakers though .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned ALL THE WAY DOWN , but it is all right because these are computer speakers .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: These are more suitable for hip hop or rock , the dialogue sounds unnatural and piano music sounds like MIDI ll .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Some may not like the horn tweeters , as they tend to sound too hot .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I usually avoid horns but I do not hear anything overly extreme .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: This system is very powerful .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: It played clean up to the highest levels except for the subwoofer which had port noise .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: It effortlessly filled by medium-sized room with sound .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Do not be mislead by the THX logo on it , though .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The requirements for computer speakers are not as strict as the ones for theater equipment .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: In other words , you are not going to watch Star Wars on this thing .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: So it all comes together .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: This is a great piece speaker system for a computer , and it is worth every penny .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Audiophiles though would not bother with such mediocre equipment so bug off and GO LISTEN TO THEIR MUSIC SOMEWHERE ELSE .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I broke this in for more than hours , not continuously or course .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: This is the best sound system I have ever heard .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: It beats my Z which I accidently destroyed by a water spill .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The woofer is much larger .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: When I saw a lot of plastic where there was metal I was concerned that the sound would not be as good .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: But it is better .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I would recommend this to anyone looking for the type of surround sound found in the theaters .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: During games it will shake your seat bottom and the floor and maybe even the neighbors floor if they live too close .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: If I were to rate these speakers on my listening needs , I would give a . stars , but I am giving because I think they do the job that most people want them for .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: What I do not like is that at lower volume music listening , tonal qualities are very poor .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I have to make equalizer adjustments for every different song to make it sound right .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: There are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the builtin speaker crossovers .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: You can not get decent midrange or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: However , once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work I like to get done with some background music , viola , the audio is great well , this is relative great for a computer speaker .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Pros : Great sound for a a speaker at mid to higher levels .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers I Ve owned .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Construction : all components are pretty rugged and seem built to last .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker no , these are not going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I Ve heard .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Cons : I think the satellites look ugly .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The metal grills remind me of is boom boxes .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Also , certifications do not impress me , so I d really rather not be reminded every time that I look at the speaker that I probably paid an extra a just for Logitech to have these THX certified .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Ported sub woofer not appropriate for this set up .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: This is a preference , but since these speakers are more than capable of loud levels , I d be willing to sacrifice some efficiency to have an enclosed woofer that is much more accurate and less redolent of a teenager is car system .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Games and video can sound very tinny if you do not do some adjustments on the software end when you switch from music .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Fixed speaker cable of why do this ?
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: To increase the likelihood that we have to buy new speakers in a few years ?
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Sub woofer is large .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: For those who want the thump that this is capable of producing very good for a computer speaker , this is probably necessary .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I just do not want this .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Conclusion : I was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day I got them .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I decided to give them a chance and I Ve gotten a little more used to them .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I am still very frustrated with some of the properties , but now that I have saved equalizer settings and know I have to open up my sound card is control panel every time I switch between music and videos or games , the sound is much more acceptable .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I really just want quality sound for listening to my music at moderate levels while I am doing work on my computer and these speakers really do not shine until you start to crank them .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I tried to adjust my rating a bit higher assuming that many people probably want exactly what these do and I am happy I do not live in an apartment next to you .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I love this speakers .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Sound quality and base is amazing .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: This tiny speakers produce really big sound .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I would strongly recommend this product !
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: This is proof that good things come in small packages .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP players , including Sansas and Spods .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I set it up in my living room and the sound was superb .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: It played my Sands e beautifully , and then we jacked in my son is IPOD Gig and it played it perfectly as well .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: This is a superb system and highly recommended .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: It is smaller than I expected when I ordered it , but as it turns out , so much the better .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: A great system at an incredible price .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I am not easily impressed by electronics , tending to be a little conservative , but this product really deserves five stars .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Operates off household current as well as batteries .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: If you do not have the smaller size Sands MP mine is bigger than the series the dock is designed for , the player does not fit in the dock , but it jacked into the audio input with a cord that is included .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: A small cosmetic issue , but good to know .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: However , because this dock plays about any MP player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: These are good looking , durable speaker stands .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I have not even used the carpet tacks that came with the stands and they are hard to knock over .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I bought them along with one of the specified speakers suggested by Harmon .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: They are seamless when looking at them straight on , but at side and views pictures that were not available on line the rear of the speaker is visible .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Overall they are great stands and look good .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Assembly is a little awkward because the drawings are not that great .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Go to Harmon on line to see better instructions if needed .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I have two , the XtremeMac Luna Voyager and this home iPGXC .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Both provide a docking port for the iPod\/iPhone on the top panel .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Both then sync with the device so as to display the time .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The XtremeMac , which is just a few dollars less expensive than the home model , has a blue florescent digit display for the clock while the home has a backlit LCD display .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: While the XtremeMac looks cooler , the home is actually more legible from a distance and easier to read at a glance .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Both , at the touch of a button , start playing music from the content of the device .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The device is then accessed to change songs .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Volume is adjusted from the home .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Both units have an alarm clock capability , with the iPod\/iPhone utilized for the musical accompaniment .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The big difference in the two units , beyond their appearance , is in sound quality .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The home , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: When I first listened to the XtremeMac , I thought there was only a single speaker .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The home is stereo reproduction is clearly superior .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Vocals have greater clarity with the home as well .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The speakers of the XtremeMac are built into the unit , out of harm is way , and this is advantageous in a dusty environment or one in which small children might poke and prod at the unit .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: On the home , the speaker domes are out in the open at the end of the unit .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: They can be easily damaged if poked .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The home has a watch-type battery to hold time if the power goes out .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: It takes four AA batteries if portability is desired away from an AC line while still using the built in speakers and amplifier .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I tested it with the original iPhone , the iPhoneGS , and the iPhone ATT and had no problems with any of these sources .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Well , a friend of mine is got the tower without the Bluetooth feature , and it was really awesome so for a long time i was willing to buy a tower from this particular brand , extra dollars for the Bluetooth feature isnt bad at all .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I got it today , it works great , great sound for its size and price , I understand that the volume for iPhone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so I do not complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iPhone , I highly recommend this tower .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I also disagree that this system sounds like a boombox .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: It sounds great !
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I chose this system in particular because it is THX Certified , so I knew it was unlikely that they d sound disappointingly bad .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: They sound wonderful , in my opinion , and I have not even touched any equalizers .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I got them for my girlfriend so she would not be stuck with W laptop speakers anymore .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I am breaking them in with some trance at a moderate volume right now .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: midrange is not the best , but it is certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend a a on computer speakers .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level at a , definitely not boomy .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: In fact , it beats my albeit year old Alter Lansing ADA system is subwoofer system originally a .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Bottom line is for the price , these things sound GREAT and have tons of good bass .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Highly recommend .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Definitely worth spending the extra money over a cheaper a system grab these instead , you all be glad you did .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: These are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: What it really is , is a pouch with speaker the zippers open up a little bucket for your sunglasses and your cell phone inside .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The waterproof feature is also true because it is still working after hours in drizzle .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The mount is easy to use it is just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I have a bike light so I had to remove it to cater enough space to put this speaker on .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: It is also a bit bigger than expected but that is OK because all I need is something to work with my iPhone .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it is a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plugin for Mac Itunes , SRS Cwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I was super excited to receive this little speaker .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I got this item for the sole reason to use on my iPad since the builtin speaker on that device is horribly low , even in quiet rooms !
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I plugged this baby in my iPod and had people in the living room speak at the same time to see if this thing can overpower that noise .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Man was I surprised !
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: This thing drowned all five people out !
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: My brother and I were equally shocked at how loud this thing really is .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: After my first test run with it , my brother took my smartphone , logged into my Amazon account , and bought one for himself .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Yes he asked first ll .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I am planning on posting a video to show how loud this thing is .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I deducted a star because , when I put my iPod and iPad on full volume , the speaker is bass began to completely ruin the sound .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: It sounded like an busted up speaker and the lyrics were muffled .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: That kind of annoyed me a lot .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: But to remedy this , all I did was set my iPod and iPad to either Treble reducer or Bass Reducer .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The sound became instantly clear again .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I do wish I could enjoy lots of bass without the sound losing quality , but the sheer volume of this thing makes up for that !
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Upon opening these I found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: They use a design that has a passive radiator that takes up most of the back of each speaker .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: You get a power\/volume knob , headphone jack , and Bluetooth button on the front and power , speaker to speaker , and linen on the back .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: There are a few things that I do not like about the design .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: There is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: They used a glossy finish on the front .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I have found that around the knob is all smudged up and scratched now from normal use .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: If would have been much nicer if they had put nubs\/tread around the volume knob , it would have provided a more positive grip and given more feedback .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: With the smooth knob I find it hard to judge if I am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Pairing to a Bluetooth device is the usual no problem activity that I have come to expect from creative speakers .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: No complaints there .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I also did not run into any problems using the speakers with any of my Bluetooth devices .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: When I first setup the speakers I saw a note in the manual to not place the speakers backs against a wall or solid surface .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I sat the speakers on my computer desk at home not up against a wall and was really me about how these sounded .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I had decided that I did not want to keep these at home and decided to take them to work because I did not need really good sounding speakers at work .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Well when I hooked these up in my cubicle at work they sounded like totally different speakers .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: I could not believe how much better they sounded .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: So the conclusion I have reached is that placement for these speakers is very important .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: They might sound good in your situation they might not .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: It is hard to tell .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: This is the best speaker mount I had so far .

product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: It is what you would expect for a a a dock .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: The sound is far from good and there is a lot of interference mainly when doing any Wifi activity .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: Volume level is OK .
product/productId:100
product/title:Speaker
review/text: material is on the cheap side .
